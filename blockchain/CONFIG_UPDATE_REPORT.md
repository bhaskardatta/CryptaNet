# CryptaNet Blockchain Network: Configuration Update Report

## Summary of Changes

We've updated the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network configuration to properly work with Fabric 2.x. The key changes include:

1. **System Channel Removal**: Removed the system channel dependency as it's deprecated in Fabric 2.x
2. **Channel Participation API**: Properly enabled and configured the orderer's channel participation API
3. **Docker Networking**: Fixed DNS resolution issues between containers
4. **Orderer Configuration**: Updated the orderer service to use Fabric 2.x features properly
5. **CLI Enhancements**: Added required tools to the CLI container for network diagnostics
6. **Script Enhancements**: Created robust scripts with fallbacks for network setup and management

## How to Start the Network

Follow these steps to start the network:

1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhaskar/Desktop/CryptaNet/blockchain/docker
   ./prepare_environment.sh
   ```

2. **Generate Crypto Material and Channel Artifacts**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhaskar/Desktop/CryptaNet/blockchain/network
   ./generate.sh
   ```

3. **Start the Network and Create Channels**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhaskar/Desktop/CryptaNet/blockchain/network
   ./startFabric.sh
   ```

4. **Run Diagnostics** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bhaskar/Desktop/CryptaNet/blockchain/network
   ./diagnostic.sh
   ```

## Troubleshooting Tools

We've created several tools to help with troubleshooting:

1. **Network Reset**: Complete network reset script
   ```bash
   ./reset_network.sh
   ```

2. **Manual Channel Creation**: Use if channel creation fails in startFabric.sh
   ```bash
   ./create_channel_manual.sh
   ```

3. **Network Diagnostics**: Comprehensive diagnostics to identify issues
   ```bash
   ./diagnostic.sh
   ```

## Technical Details

### Channel Creation Process

In Fabric 2.x, channels are created via the participation API:

1. The script converts the channel.tx file to JSON format
2. The JSON is submitted to the orderer's admin API endpoint
3. The orderer processes this request and creates the channel
4. Peers join the channel using the channel block

### Container Configuration

We've made the following container configuration changes:

1. Improved DNS resolution by adding aliases to each service
2. Added a named network with bridge driver for consistent IP assignments
3. Enabled orderer admin API on port 9443 with TLS disabled for simplicity
4. Added persistent storage for the orderer to maintain channel state

### CLI Container Enhancements

The CLI container now has:
1. Additional diagnostic tools (jq, netcat, curl)
2. Improved host resolution and DNS configuration
3. Scripts to test connectivity and manage channels

## Next Steps

1. Test chaincode deployment on the network
2. Configure proper TLS for production environments
3. Implement organization-specific MSP management
4. Configure proper access control and policies

## Summary

The blockchain network should now be fully functional with Fabric 2.x, with robust channel creation and peer joining processes. The configuration uses the modern channel participation API rather than the deprecated system channel approach.
