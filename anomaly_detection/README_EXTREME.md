  - Lift charts for business value assessment
  - Synthetic edge case testing with supply chain disruptions, adversarial examples, and out-of-distribution samples

## USAGE

### Training the Extreme Optimization Model

```bash
# For full training with 1,000,000 samples and 100 optimization trials
python train_extreme_model.py

# For quick testing with smaller dataset
python train_extreme_model.py --num_samples=10000 --n_trials=5
```

### Evaluating with Edge Cases

```python
# Example code for evaluating with synthetic edge cases
from evaluation.synthetic_edge_case_generator import SyntheticEdgeCaseGenerator
from evaluation.advanced_evaluator import AdvancedEvaluator
from models.ensemble_detector import HierarchicalEnsembleDetector

# Load trained model
model = HierarchicalEnsembleDetector.load_model('saved_models/extreme_optimized_model.joblib')

# Generate edge cases
edge_case_generator = SyntheticEdgeCaseGenerator()
edge_data, edge_labels = edge_case_generator.generate_mixed_edge_cases(num_samples=1000)

# Evaluate model on edge cases
evaluator = AdvancedEvaluator()
predictions = model.predict(edge_data)
decision_scores = model.decision_function(edge_data)

# Generate comprehensive report
evaluator.generate_comprehensive_report(
    edge_labels, predictions, decision_scores,
    timestamps=edge_data['timestamp'],
    cost_matrix={"fp_cost": 1.0, "fn_cost": 5.0}
)
```

## NOTES

- For optimal performance, run on Apple Silicon hardware with MLX acceleration
- The full training process with 1,000,000 samples may take several hours
- For production deployment, implement the drift detection mechanisms in `train_extreme_model.py`
- Adjust cost matrix parameters in `advanced_evaluator.py` based on your specific business requirements
